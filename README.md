# SDR_GNURadio

Software Defined Radio with GNU Radio

Please feel free to share, fork, and use the materials for educational purposes.

I also urge you to create wiki pages so we can improve the course content with additional reference material.

This is based on the tutorial created and provided by Balint Seeber and Ettus Research. So many thanks to both.

The tutorials are found here:

http://files.ettus.com/tutorials/

Please visit and provide feedback to Balint via his page:

Also, visit his GitHub page at:

Keep in mind, Lab 4 and 5 ask for Ettus Research SDRs.
We will be using the RTL-SDR with the 820T (or E4000) for Lab 4.

*** You will need an active HAM license for Lab 5 ***

If there are any other issues or concerns with the materials, please let me know.

Thanks and enjoy learning!
