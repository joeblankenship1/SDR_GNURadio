# SDR_GNURadio

Software Defined Radio with GNU Radio

This is based on the tutorial created and provided by Balint Seeber and Ettus Research. So many thanks to both.

The tutorials are found here:

Keep in mind, Lab 4 and 5 ask for Ettus Research SDRs.
We will be using the RTL-SDR with the 820T (or E4000) for Lab 4.

*** You will need an active HAM license for Lab 5 ***
